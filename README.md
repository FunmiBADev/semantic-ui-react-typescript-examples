# Semantic UI, React, and TypeScript Examples

Several examples built with [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Each example was created with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) and [react-scripts-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts) using the following command:

``` bash
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

For local development, run `npm start` in the root directory of any of these examples, and it will automatically start a server, launch the example in your browser, and watch for any changes that you make to the code. The page will reload with your changes automatically!
